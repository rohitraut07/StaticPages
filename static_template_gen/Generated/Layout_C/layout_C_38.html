                <p>
                    A fire consumed the famed Fulton Fish Market’s century-old Tin Building on the afternoon of March 29, 1995. About 15 of the nearly 60 different businesses at the market operated out of that building. The four-alarm blaze left the structure in ruins, and sent plumes of black smoke over the city skyline that was visible for miles. The fire was quickly discovered to be the work of arsonists, after investigators found trails of gasoline at the location.
