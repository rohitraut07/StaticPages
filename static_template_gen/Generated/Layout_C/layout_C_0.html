                    George Floyd was killed during an arrest on May 25, 2020, after police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for over eight minutes. Chauvin, along with officers Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao, who were also called to the scene, were fired and all have been charged with second-degree murder; the latter three have also been charged with second-degree manslaughter. Floyd’s death has sparked national and global protests denouncing police brutality and uplifting the Black Lives Matter movement.
