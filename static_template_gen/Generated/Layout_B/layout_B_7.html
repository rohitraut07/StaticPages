                    A mixed martial artist who watched George Floyd’s death last spring was so upset by Derek Chauvin’s actions during the fatal arrest that he felt the need to call 911 on the police, he told the jury during the second day of witness testimony in the ex-cop’s trial Tuesday. “I did call the police on the police... because I believe I witnessed a murder,” former college wrestler Donald Williams said.}
