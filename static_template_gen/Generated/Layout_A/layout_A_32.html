                    The concern is real, but assessing the problem’s scope has been a challenge. Surveys that simply ask people about their weight are notoriously unreliable, and many medical visits have been virtual.

                <p>
                    Black jockeys once dominated - and indeed, established - the Kentucky Derby, but their stories got sidelined when African-Americans were pushed out by Jim Crow laws in the early 1900s. But a newly expanded exhibit at the Kentucky Derby Museum highlights the founding role that Black horsemen have played in the famed race.
